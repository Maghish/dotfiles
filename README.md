# dotfiles

My OS is **Windows 11** but I use **ArchLinux** using WSL.

You can view my Neovim configuration, as well as TMUX. I have couple of ricing modes, well it's not really ricing but it's some sort. You can view those on [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file.

Overall, **Neovim is cool but VSCode is always smooth and better <3**
